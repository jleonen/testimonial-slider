## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project has given me the opportunity to use HTML CSS and Javascript to be able to make a slider displaying each testimonial. This skill will be important as sliders are common to see in other websites. I also had the chance to use some CSS properties that I haven't had the chance of using, such as the Overflow property and Transition property, which helped with making the sliding animations. It also gave me the opportunity to practice with using Z-indexes. I learned about how to position elements in front or behind each other using Z-index.

### Continued development

I believe that I could use more practice with using z-indices, as they may be important in the future. There are also more CSS properties that I can learn more about as well. For example, I would like to get to know more about how to make animations using HTML and CSS in the future.

### Useful resources

- [w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me get an idea of how to structure my HTML as well as CSS styles that can help me. It also helped me get an idea of the logic I would need to make the slider work.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) - I specifically used a project from Udemy that went over how to make a testimonial slider. So I studied that code and used the Javascript logic from there in order to make the slider work.
